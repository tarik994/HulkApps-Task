project Practical Test Exam

developer: Tarik Abazovic
developing of web application.

Time spent on the project is 8 working hours. I worked on a project all week after work.



I have used plain JS because it is best indicator how much developer understand developing process. 
The reason why I didn't use framework is lack of time due projects on my current work, but in different circumstances and generally in my work I prefer to use Angular, Angular JS, Vuejs.
For few things on project I have a better solution, but as I said before, due less time I had to focus on functionality first than on details.


in next few points I will explain what would I do better:

- all fix codes I would write through JS and all photos save in arrays
- Disanventages in CSS are also long codes, for this I have better ways for an organisation and that is SCSS which I also know how to use.
- Also have few ideas how to improve my projects and to focus more on details
- Need few hours to make web application Responsive. Few examples which I made have forwarded previously.
- Web application has very interesting details and vivid colors, I liked to make application in Angular and also do backend, 
  give more friendly function to the buttons and make an admin panel for optional adjustment of text and photos.
